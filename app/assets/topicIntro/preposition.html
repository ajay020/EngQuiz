    <h1>Prepositions</h1>

    <p>
      Prepositions are words that show the relationship between a noun or
      pronoun and another word in a sentence. They can be used to indicate
      location, direction, time, manner, cause, or purpose.
    </p>

    <p>Here are some examples of prepositions:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Location: in, on, at, near, behind, in front of, above, below, next to
      </li>
      <li>
        Direction: to, from, towards, away from, through, across, into, out of
      </li>
      <li>Time: at, on, in, before, after, during, since, until</li>
      <li>Manner: by, with, according to, in spite of, despite, like</li>
      <li>Cause: because of, due to, owing to, on account of</li>
      <li>Purpose: for, in order to, so as to</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Prepositions can be used in single or multiple prepositional phrases. A
      prepositional phrase consists of a preposition and the noun or pronoun
      that it modifies.

    <h2>How to Use "In" and "Into"</h2>

    <p>
      The prepositions "in" and "into" are both used to indicate location, but
      they have different meanings and usages.
    </p>

    <p>
      **In** is used to indicate that something is enclosed or contained within
      something else. For example:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>The cat is in the box.</li>
      <li>The water is in the glass.</li>
      <li>The money is in the bank.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      **Into** is used to indicate that something is moving towards or entering
      something else. For example:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>The cat jumped into the box.</li>
      <li>The water poured into the glass.</li>
      <li>The man walked into the bank.</li>
    </ul>
