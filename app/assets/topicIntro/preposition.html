      <h2>How to Use "In" and "Into"</h2>

      <p>
        The prepositions "in" and "into" are both used to indicate location, but
        they have different meanings and usages.

        **In** is used to indicate that something is enclosed or contained
        within something else. For example:

      <ul>
        <li>The cat is in the box.</li>
        <li>The water is in the glass.</li>
        <li>The money is in the bank.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        **Into** is used to indicate that something is moving towards or
        entering something else. For example:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>The cat jumped into the box.</li>
        <li>The water poured into the glass.</li>
        <li>The man walked into the bank.</li>
