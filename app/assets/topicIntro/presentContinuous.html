    <h2><strong>Sentence structure</strong></h2>

    <p>
      The present continuous tense is formed using the auxiliary verb "am,"
      "is," or "are" and the present participle of the main verb. The present
      participle is the verb with "ing" on the end.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong
        >Subject + am/is/are + present participle + rest of sentence</strong
      >
    </p>
    <blockquote>
