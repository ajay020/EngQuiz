    <h1 style="text-align: center">Adverbs</h1>

    <p>
      Adverbs are words that modify verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs.
      <br />
      <br />
      They can tell us how, when, where, why, or to what degree something is
      done.
    </p>

    <p>Here are some examples of adverbs:</p>

    <ul>
      <li style="margin-bottom: 10px">
        <b>Adverbs of manner</b> : quickly, slowly, carefully, loudly, softly
      </li>
      <li style="margin-bottom: 10px">
        <b>Adverbs of time</b>: now, then, soon, later, yesterday, today,
        tomorrow
      </li>
      <li style="margin-bottom: 10px">
        <b>Adverbs of place</b>: here, there, everywhere, nowhere, upstairs,
        downstairs
      </li>
      <li style="margin-bottom: 10px">
        <b>Adverbs of reason </b>: why, because, therefore, since, so that, in
        order to
      </li>
      <li style="margin-bottom: 10px">
        <b>Adverbs of degree </b>: very, quite, extremely, too, enough
      </li>
      <li style="margin-bottom: 10px">
        <b>Adverbs of frequency</b>: always, usually, often, sometimes, rarely,
        never
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>How Adverbs Work:</h3>

    <ul>
      <li style="margin-bottom: 10px">
        <b>Modifying Verbs</b>: Adverbs add detail to verbs, telling us how an
        action occurs. For example, "She sings beautifully." Here, "beautifully"
        describes how she sings.
      </li>
      <li style="margin-bottom: 10px">
        <b>Modifying Adjectives</b>: They can also describe adjectives. In "an
        incredibly talented artist," "incredibly" enhances the meaning of
        "talented."
      </li>
      <li style="margin-bottom: 10px">
        <b>Modifying Other Adverbs</b>: Adverbs can even modify other adverbs.
        In "He runs very quickly," "very" emphasizes the adverb "quickly."
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Adverbs can be placed before the verb, after the verb, or at the beginning
      of the sentence. For example:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><b>Quickly</b> run to the store.</li>
      <li>I ran <b>quickly</b> to the store.</li>
      <li><b>Quickly</b>, I ran to the store.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>More example:</h3>

    <ul>
      <li style="margin-bottom: 8px">She sang <b>beautifully</b>.</li>
      <li style="margin-bottom: 8px">
        He walked <b>slowly</b> down the street.
      </li>
      <li style="margin-bottom: 8px">The car drove <b>quickly</b> past us.</li>
      <li style="margin-bottom: 8px">
        She spoke <b>softly</b> so as not to disturb the baby.
      </li>
      <li style="margin-bottom: 8px">He runs <b>very quickly</b></li>
      <li style="margin-bottom: 8px">
        The dog barked <b>loudly</b> at the mailman.
      </li>
    </ul>
