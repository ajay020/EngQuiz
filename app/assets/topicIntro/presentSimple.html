    <h1>Present Simple Tense: A Quick Guide</h1>

    <h2>When to Use It:</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Habits and Routines:</strong> We use the Present Simple to talk
        about things we do regularly. For example, "I
        <em>brush my teeth</em> every morning."
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Facts and General Truths:</strong> It's perfect for stating
        facts or things that are always true. For instance, "The
        <em>sun rises</em> in the east."
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Scheduled Events:</strong> We can also use it to talk about
        scheduled events like timetables or fixed plans. "The
        <em>train leaves</em> at 9 AM."
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Sentence Structure:</h2>
    <p>
      Making sentences in the Present Simple Tense is easy. You usually just
      need the base form of the verb (the form you find in the dictionary) with
      's' or 'es' added for third-person singular (he, she, it).
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Affirmative (Positive) Sentences:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>I/You/We/They + <em>base form of the verb</em></li>
          <li>He/She/It + <em>base form of the verb</em> + 's' or 'es'</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Negative Sentences:</strong> Use 'do not' (don't) or 'does not'
        (doesn't) before the base form of the verb.
        <ul>
          <li>Example: "She <em>doesn't like</em> spinach."</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Questions:</strong> Start the sentence with 'do' or 'does',
        followed by the subject, and then the base form of the verb.
        <ul>
          <li>Example: "Do you like pizza?"</li>
          <li>Example: "Does she go to school by bus?"</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Examples:</h2>
    <p><strong>Affirmative:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>"I play soccer every Saturday."</li>
      <li>"She reads books in the evening."</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Negative:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>"They don't watch scary movies."</li>
      <li>"He doesn't eat meat."</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Questions:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>"Do you like pizza?"</li>
      <li>"Does she go to school by bus?"</li>
    </ul>
