    <h1>Past Perfect Tense</h1>
    <p>
      The past perfect tense is used to describe actions or events that occurred
      before another action or event in the past.
    </p>

    <h2>When to Use the Past Perfect Tense:</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Past Actions Before Other Past Actions:</strong> We use the past
      perfect to indicate that one action or event happened before another
      action in the past.<br /><br />
      For example:<br /><br />
      She <b>had</b> already finished her homework when the guests arrived.
    </p>

    <h2>Sentence Structure:</h2>
    <p>
      To form the past perfect tense, we use the past tense of the auxiliary
      verb "had" and add the past participle of the main verb.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Subject + had + past participle + (rest of the sentence)</strong>
    </p>

    <h2>Examples:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>"I <b>had</b> never seen that movie before last night."</li>
      <li>"They <b>had</b> already eaten when I got to the restaurant."</li>
      <li>"By the time I arrived, she <b>had</b> left."</li>
    </ul>
