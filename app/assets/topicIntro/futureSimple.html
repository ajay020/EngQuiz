      happen at some point in the future.
    </p>

    <h2>The future simple tense can be used to:</h2>
    <div class="future-simple-tense">

    <h2>Sentence Structure</h2>

    <i>Subject + will/shall + base form of the verb (+ rest of the sentence)</i>

    <br /><br />

    <h2>Will vs Shall</h2>

    <div class="future-simple-tense-usage">
      <h3>Will -> common usage</h3>
      <p>
        "Will" is the more commonly used word to express the future in everyday
        conversation and writing.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>I will call you later.</li>
        <li>It will rain tomorrow.</li>
        <li>They will arrive at 9 AM.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="future-simple-tense-formality">
      <h3>Shall -> formality</h3>
      <p>
        "Shall" is considered more formal than "will."
        <br />
        It is often used in formal documents, legal contexts, and certain types
        of written or spoken English.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>I shall submit the report by Friday.(formal)</li>
        <li><em>Shall I book a table for two?</em> (suggestion)</li>
        <li>We shall meet at the conference next week.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>am/is/are + going to + base form verb</h2>
      <p>
        We can express the future in two ways: <b>"will"</b> and
        <b>going to.</b> <br /><br />
        Both can be used to talk about events that are planned or expected to
        happen in the future, but there are some subtle differences between the
        two.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b> Will</b> is generally used to express future events that are
        uncertain or less planned.
      </p>
      <p>Examples:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          I <b>will</b> call you later. (I haven't decided when yet, but I plan
          to call you at some point today.)
        </li>
        <li>
          It <b>will</b> rain tomorrow. (I'm not sure if it will rain tomorrow,
          but the meteorologist says it's likely.)
        </li>

        <li>
          He <b>will</b> be late. (I'm pretty sure he's going to be late, but
          I'm not 100% sure.)
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        <b>Going to</b> is generally used to express future events that are more
        certain or more planned.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          I <b>am going to</b> the store later. (I have already decided that I'm
          going to the store later.)
        </li>
        <li>
          We<b>'re going to</b> have a meeting tomorrow. (The meeting has
          already been scheduled.)
        </li>
        <li>
          She<b>'s going to</b> be a doctor. (She has already decided that she
          wants to be a doctor and has taken steps to achieve that goal.)
        </li>
      </ol>
