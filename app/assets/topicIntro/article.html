    <h1>Articles</h1>

    <p>
      Articles are small words that precede nouns to indicate their definiteness
      or indefiniteness.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Indefinite article:</b> a / an</li>
      <li><b>Definite article:</b> the</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 style="text-align: center">a/an</h2>

    <p><b>Use "a" before words that start with a consonant sound.</b></p>

    <ul>
      <li><b>A</b> book</li>
      <li><b>A</b> car</li>
      <li><b>A</b> dog</li>
      <li><b>A</b> house</li>
      <li><b>A</b> table</li>
    </ul>

    <p><b>Use "an" before words that start with a vowel sound.</b></p>

    <ul>
      <li><b>An</b> apple</li>
      <li><b>An</b> egg</li>
      <li><b>An</b> umbrella</li>
      <li><b>An</b> hour</li>
      <li><b>An</b> island</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Exceptions</h3>

    <ul>
      <li><b>Use "an" before words that start with a silent "h".</b></li>
      <li><b>An</b> hour</li>
      <li><b>An</b> honor</li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <b
          >Use "a" before words that start with a pronounced "h" if the "h" is
          pronounced like a consonant.</b
        >
      </li>
      <li><b>A</b> house</li>
      <li><b>A</b> history</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      In general, use "a" or "an" when you are talking about something for the
      first time or when you are not referring to a specific thing.
    </p>

    <p>I would like to buy <b>a</b> book. (Any book.)</p>
    <p>I saw <b>a</b> bird in the sky. (Any bird.)</p>

    <p>
      Do not use "a" or "an" when you are talking about a specific thing or when
      you are using a plural noun.
    </p>

    <p><b>The</b> book is on the table. (A specific book.)</p>
    <p>I have two dogs. (Plural noun.)</p>

    <!-- the article  -->

    <h2 style="text-align: center">the</h2>

    <p>
      The definite article <b>the</b>
      is used to refer to specific or particular nouns.
      <br />
      <br />
      For example, if I say "I want to read <b>the</b> book on the table," I am
      referring to a specific book that is already known to the listener.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Use <b>the</b> when referring to specific or particular nouns that have
        already been mentioned or are known to the listener.
        <ul>
          <li>I saw <b>the</b> man who stole my wallet. (A specific man.)</li>
          <li>I live in <b>the</b> house on the corner. (A specific house.)</li>
          <li>I'm going to <b>the</b> movie tonight. (A specific movie.)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Use <b>the</b> when referring to nouns that are unique or one of a kind.
        <ul>
          <li><b>the</b> sun</li>
          <li><b>the</b> moon</li>
          <li><b>the</b> president</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Use <b>the</b> when referring to things that are considered to be part
        of a group or category.
        <ul>
          <li><b>the</b> members of the team</li>
          <li><b>the</b> students in the class</li>
          <li><b>the</b> animals in the zoo</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Use <b>the</b> when referring to things that are considered to be
        general or abstract.
        <ul>
          <li><b>the</b> truth</li>
          <li><b>the</b> future</li>
          <li><b>the</b> internet</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Use <b>the</b> when referring to things that are superlative or the best
        of their kind.
        <ul>
          <li><b>the</b> best player in the world</li>
          <li><b>the</b> most beautiful woman in the room</li>
          <li><b>the</b> tallest building in the city</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>More examples:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>I saw <b>the</b> man who stole my wallet. (A specific man.)</li>
      <li>I live in <b>the</b> house on the corner. (A specific house.)</li>
      <li>I'm going to <b>the</b> movie tonight. (A specific movie.)</li>
    </ul>

      <li>I'm going to see <b>a</b> doctor tomorrow. (Any doctor.)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Exceptions</h3>

    <p>
      There are a few exceptions to the rules for using articles. For example,
      we do not use articles with:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Uncountable nouns (e.g., water, air, love)</li>
      <li>Proper nouns (e.g., John, Mary, London)</li>
      <li>
        Nouns that are used in a general sense (e.g., Dogs are loyal animals.)
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      For example, we would say "I need some water" (not "I need
      <b>a</b> water") and "I'm going to London" (not "I'm going to
      <b>the</b> London").
