    <h1>Present Perfect Tense</h1>
    <p>
      The present perfect tense is used to talk about actions that started in
      the past and continue to the present, or actions that were completed in
      the past but have a result that is still relevant in the present.
    </p>

    <h2>When to Use the Present Perfect Tense</h2>
    <p>You can use the present perfect tense in the following situations:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          Actions or events that happened at an unspecified time in the past but
          have relevance or an impact on the present.<br />For example:
        </p>
        <p>
          I have visited Paris. (The action of visiting Paris happened at an
          unspecified time in the past, and it's relevant to the present.)
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Actions or events that started in the past and continue into the
          present. For example:
        </p>
        <p>
          She has lived in this city for ten years. (She started living in the
          city in the past, and she still lives there now.)
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Actions or events that have just been completed. For example:</p>
        <p>
          They have just finished their homework. (The action of finishing the
          homework has just been completed.)
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
