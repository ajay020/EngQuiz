    <h1>Modal Verbs</h1>
    <p>
      Modal verbs are auxiliary verbs that are used to express possibility,
      necessity, permission, or obligation. They are used with a main verb to
      indicate the speaker's attitude towards the action or event.
    </p>

      <h2>Types of Modal Verbs:</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Can:</strong> This modal verb is used to express the ability
          or capability to do something.
          <p>Example: She <em>can</em> play the piano.</p>
        </li>
        <li>

          <p>Example 2: It <em>may</em> rain later. (Possibility)</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Might:</strong> Similar to 'may,' it denotes a possibility,
          often with a sense of uncertainty.

        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Must:</strong> This modal verb indicates necessity or strong

        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Should:</strong> It's used to provide advice or make a
          suggestion.
          <p>Example: You <em>should</em> study for the exam.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Shall:</strong> Often used in questions, offers, or
          suggestions, and it's more common in British English.
          <p>Example 1: <em>Shall</em> we go to the park?</p>
          <p>Example 2: I <em>shall</em> do my best.</p>
        </li>

          <p>Example 2: I <em>will</em> help you with your project.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Would:</strong> It is used for polite requests, conditional
          statements, or expressing willingness.
          <p>Example 1: <em>Would</em> you like some tea?</p>
          <p>Example 2: If I were you, I <em>would</em> apologize.</p>

      <h2>Difference between 'may' and 'might':</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>May is used to express:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Stronger possibility in present and future.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Maight is used to express:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Weaker possibility in present and future.</li>
            <li>To talk about past or hypothetical possibilities</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

      <h2>Key Points:</h2>

        <li>Modal verbs don't have different forms for different subjects.</li>
        <li>They are always followed by the base form of the main verb.</li>
      </ul>
