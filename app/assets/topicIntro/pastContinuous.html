    <h1>The Past Continuous Tense</h1>

    <p>
      The past continuous tense helps us describe actions or events that were in
      progress at a specific moment in the past.<br />
      It paints a picture of what was happening while something else occurred.
      It's like looking back in time and seeing actions unfold.
    </p>

    <h2>When to Use It:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Ongoing Actions in the Past:</strong> Use the past continuous
          tense to describe actions or events that were happening at a certain
          time in the past. For example, "I was studying when the phone rang."
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Parallel Actions:</strong> It's perfect for showing that two
          or more actions were happening simultaneously. For instance, "While
          she was cooking dinner, he was watching TV."
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Setting the Scene:</strong> It helps set the scene or provide
          background information in a narrative. "The sun was setting, and birds
          were singing."
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Sentence Structure:</h2>
    <p>
      To form the past continuous tense, we use the past tense of the verb "to
      be" (was/were) and add the present participle of the main verb with -ing.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong
        >Subject + was/were + present participle + (rest of the
        sentence)</strong
      >
    </p>

    <h2>Examples:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>I was reading a book when it started raining.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>They were playing soccer while the sun was setting.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>She was laughing so hard that tears were streaming down her face.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The past continuous tense brings past moments to life, letting us
      experience the action and atmosphere of that time. It's a useful tool for
      storytelling and vividly describing the past.
