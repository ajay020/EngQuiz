      Put a question mark at the end of a sentence that asks a question.<br /><br />

      <strong>3. Exclamation Point (!) - Strong Emotions:</strong><br />
      Use an exclamation point to show strong emotions or excitement.<br /><br />
      Example: Wow! That was amazing!
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>4. Comma (,) - Separating Ideas:</strong><br />
      Use commas to separate items in a list or to set off parts of a
      sentence.<br /><br />

    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>5. Apostrophe (') - Showing Possession or Contractions:</strong
      ><br />
      Use an apostrophe to show possession (someone's something) or in
      contractions (can't, don't).<br /><br />
      Example: The cat's tail is fluffy. I can't wait to see you.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>6. Quotation Marks (") - Quoting Speech or Text:</strong><br />
      Use quotation marks to show someone's exact words.<br /><br />
      Example: She said, "I'll be there at 3 o'clock."
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>7. Colon (:) - Introducing Lists or Explanations:</strong><br />
      Use a colon before a list or to introduce an explanation or example.<br /><br />
      Example: I have three favorite colors: blue, green, and yellow.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>8. Semicolon (;) - Connecting Related Ideas:</strong><br />
      Use a semicolon to connect closely related ideas in a sentence.<br /><br />
      Example: I love hiking; it makes me feel peaceful.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>9. Dash (—) - Emphasizing or Adding Information:</strong><br />
      Use a dash to emphasize or add information within a sentence.<br /><br />
      Example: My sister— the one with the curly hair— is coming over.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>10. Parentheses () - Adding Extra Information:</strong><br />
      Use parentheses to include additional information that is not essential to
      the main point.<br /><br />
      Example: The concert (which lasted two hours) was fantastic.
    </p>

    <strong>Note:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Always end a sentence with a period, question mark, or exclamation
        point.<br />
      </li>
      <li>
        Commas help separate ideas, while apostrophes show possession or create
        contractions. <br />
      </li>
      <li>
        Quotation marks are like "speech bubbles" for what someone said. <br />
      </li>
