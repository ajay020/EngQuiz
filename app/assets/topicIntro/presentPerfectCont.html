    <h1>Present Perfect Continuous Tense</h1>
    <p>
      The present perfect continuous tense is used to talk about actions that
      started in the past and continue to the present. It emphasizes the
      duration or ongoing nature of an action that began in the past and has
      relevance in the present.
    </p>

    <h2>When to Use the Present Perfect Continuous Tense</h2>
    <p>
      You can use the present perfect continuous tense in the following
      situations:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          Actions that started in the past and are still ongoing in the present.
          For example:
        </p>
        <p>
          She has been working at the company for five years. (She started
          working in the past, and she is still working there now.)
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Actions that have recently stopped but have a noticeable effect or
          result in the present.<br />For example:
        </p>
        <p>
          It's raining because the clouds have been gathering. (The action of
          gathering clouds recently stopped, but it has a noticeable effect,
          which is the rain.)
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Actions that started in the past, continued for a while, and then
          recently finished.<br />For example:
        </p>
        <p>
          He has been studying for his exams all night. (He started studying in
          the past, continued studying for a while, and has just finished.)
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
